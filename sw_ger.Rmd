## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Choice of the corpus
```{r}
corpusname <- "rus"
```

Downloading CSV files of plays
```{r}
corpusname
list_of_names <- fromJSON(paste0("https://dracor.org/api/corpora/", corpusname))
sorted_ids <- list_of_names$dramas$id[sort.list(list_of_names$dramas$id)]
plays <- mclapply(sorted_ids, function(x) read.csv(paste0("https://dracor.org/api/corpora/", 
                  corpusname, "/play/", x, "/networkdata/csv"), stringsAsFactors = F))
plays[[1]]
```

Removing of 'Type' and 'Weight' variables
```{r}
del_vars <- function(play){
  play$Type <- NULL
  play$Weight <- NULL
  return (play)
}
plays <- mclapply(plays, del_vars)
plays[[1]]
```
  
Downloading metadata
```{r}
metadata <- read.csv(paste0("https://dracor.org/api/corpora/", corpusname, "/metadata.csv"),
                     stringsAsFactors = F)
metadata <- metadata[order(metadata$name),]
```

Creating graphs of plays
```{r}
graphs_of_plays <- mclapply(plays, function(x) graph_from_data_frame(x, directed = F))
str(graphs_of_plays)
#CC <- sapply(graphs_of_plays, transitivity)

```
  
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
